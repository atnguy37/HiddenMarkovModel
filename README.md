# Hidden Markov Model
Hidden Markov Model with Python code from scratch.
## Description
This project implements three tasks of Hidden Markov Model
* Generating 10 sequences of observations from given Hidden Markov Model with \lambda.
* Implementing the Forward algorithm to classify the following sequences
* Implementing the Viterbi algorithm to decode the hidden states
